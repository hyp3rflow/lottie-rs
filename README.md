# Try it out

The default player implementation uses [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) to render the animation.

```bash
cd crates/player
cargo r --release -- --input ../../fixtures/ui/drink.json
```

There are some lottie files for demonstration purpose under `fixtures/ui`

# Headless runner

Exporting animation headlessly is also supported, aiming to render animations on a server. Currently we support
`webp` exporting for test purpose.

```bash
cd crates/player
cargo r --release -- --input ../../fixtures/ui/drink.json --headless
```

# Font Loading

This library uses [font-toolkit](https://github.com/alibaba/font-toolkit) to manage/load/use fonts, which
is also MIT-licensed.
